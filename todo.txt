Bugs: 
DONE - Some kind of JSON-parsing bug causes the IRC client to die

Long-term goals:
TODO - Add CLIENT to RESPONSE (so that a response from one client can trigger a message on a different client)
TODO - Have queues for each client, and add the ability for one client to trigger a message in another client's queue.
 - The client API is a void giveMessage() method and a List<Request> getMessages() method.
 - Need some way of saying a queue's activity is too old and delete it, such as when testing new clients.
TODO - Add CLIENT to say/act
TODO - Support Hangouts
TODO - Support Alexa - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
TODO - Support Discord - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
NOPE - Support Line - Will never happen.
TODO - Add transactions to SQL
TODO - Move everything to SQL
TODO - Add EXPLAIN mode, to print out which handlers did what to help understand some behaviour.
TODO - Maven/Dependency management
TODO - Spring/DI
DONE - Remove IRC libraries/client.
TODO - Automated tests and related refactoring to enable tests (will definitely require better DI)
